    "- Class is a blueprint to create objects.\n",
    "- Integer, Float, String, etc., are in-built types in Python.\n",
    "- To create our type like a computer, we have to create our own class for it. \n",
    "- To use the type that you have created, you need to define a class for it.\n",

    "- If we will return the type of an object, then it will print the class name. It means an object belongs to a type of particular class.\n",
    "- String, integer, etc are also object that belongs to some in-build class like str and int respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4\n",
    "- We can call any method from a class.\n",
    "- The behaviour of every object will be different from each other so need to define for which object, you are calling a method.\n",
